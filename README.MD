This project started as a simple flyer, intended to be created using only HTML and CSS. However, true to my nature as a developer, I couldn't resist pushing the boundaries and making it more than just a basic bounty project.

What youâ€™re seeing now is my vision for the future of flyers: flexible, interactive, and designed to let you have fun while tweaking the design creatively. Although the project is a part of a bounty challenge, I plan to continue improving it even after the bounty closes. For now, I hope you enjoy experimenting with it and engaging with the design!

# Important: This project is incredibly meaningful to me. It took about 5-6 days to complete, and I poured a lot of creativity into every aspect of it.
